After posting my Blog, this are the comments that I got:

Carson:
Hey Isaac, here is some feedback for your data set creation post:
- I like how you explained the benefits and limitations of your api, made it easy to follow and understand your dataset
- It is called JSON not JASON
- I like your inclusion of visuals and code blocks. also you commented your code which is great
- I wish I had more constructive advice for you but I think this is a stellar blog post. Not much else I could think of to change.

Garrett Springer:
This looks great! I liked how you did some very simple eda to figure out what the data looked like before you even made your dashboard.

Aaron Brown:
Hey Isaac!
I have to agree, I think this is an awesome post—great hook before you dive in and the topic is very fascinating. The organization of the post in general is also super well done. My one suggestion would be to look at the last paragraph—there are just some simple grammatical errors like "This was a time consuming," with the extra "a", but other than that I think it's fantastic!

Highlighted Improvements:
With the feedback that I was given, I proofread my article again and just made the grammatical and spelling changes I was suggested.
