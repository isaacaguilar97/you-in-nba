After posting my Blog, this are the comments that I got:

Carson:
Hey Isaac, here is some feedback for your data set creation post:
- I like how you explained the benefits and limitations of your api, made it easy to follow and understand your dataset
- It is called JSON not JASON
- I like your inclusion of visuals and code blocks. also you commented your code which is great
- I wish I had more constructive advice for you but I think this is a stellar blog post. Not much else I could think of to change.

Garrett Springer:
This looks great! I liked how you did some very simple eda to figure out what the data looked like before you even made your dashboard.
