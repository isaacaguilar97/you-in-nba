William:
The blog post is good overall. However, it might need a grammar and spelling check before you submit it, and I think it would benefit from explanations of some of the abbreviations. 
Also, the link to your dashboard in the blog post actually goes to the practice one we made in class.

Brandon Wegrowski:
I love the banner image and the compass image - makes it easier to read and breaks up some text. 
You also do a great job of walking through each question and visualization in a logical narrative. 
This made it easy to follow. 
Engaging subject as well (I'm a big basketball fan)!

I was able to implement Williams feedback and resulted in a more profesional blog. I also would have been lost without the link to my actual Dashboard if it weren't for William.
