Adriana (my wife):
I loved your dashboard. I'm glad you were able to work on something that you like. This is definitely going to help you as you are looking for internships and jobs.
My only recommendations are to add a boxplot showing height per position and to fix your abbreviation table to contain the actual abbreviations. Love you!

Sam Lee:
Hey Isaac, I loved your dashboard! I loved the organization and how yo explained everything throughout. 
I also liked how you themed everything about comparing ourselves to real NBA players. It's a neat idea. 
A couple of things I would suggest would be to add the player postion acronymns to your table as well where you explain what the words mean--just for no-basketball audiences. Additionally, it could be nice to have a button to switch between meters/inches for the height, just so we accommodate both American and global audiences.

Brandon Wegrowski:
Streamlit: Love the app! Really engaging approach to have the user imagine themselves as an NBA player and explore the data from that perspective. 
The sidebar is great too (especially the abbreviation index - very helpful!)

I really liked the feedback I was given. Because of it, I was able to provide value to a broader audience, and fixed any bzugs I had.
