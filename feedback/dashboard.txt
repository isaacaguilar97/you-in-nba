Adriana (my wife):
I loved your dashboard. I'm glad you were able to work on something that you like. This is definitely going to help you as you are looking for internships and jobs.
My only recommendations are to add a boxplot showing height per position and to fix your abbreviation table to contain the actual abbreviations. Love you!
